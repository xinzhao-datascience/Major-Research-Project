**Abstract**

Bike-sharing have been increasing popularity in recent years due to its usage flexibility, reduction in traffic congestion and carbon footprint. Being able to accurately predict each bike-sharing stationâ€™s demand at any given hour is crucial for inventory management. This report first manipulated Bike Share Toronto ridership data with Toronto City Center weather data from 2016 Quarter 4 to 2017 Quarter 4, then implemented machine learning algorithms in particular Regression Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to forecast station based hourly bike-sharing demand in the City of Toronto. The results indicated that Random Forest based prediction model was the most accurate model by comparing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of all bike-sharing stations.
